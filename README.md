# Overview

## What is this project?

The goal of this project is to collaborate with Collab Lab teammates to create a “smart” shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you’re likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

## How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) and when you will want to buy it next (e.g., "Soon", "Kind of Soon", or "Not Soon"). Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.

## What technologies were used?

Front-End: React, Bootstrap, Material UI

Back-End: Firebase, Firestore
